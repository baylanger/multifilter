Here's a little bit of informations on how to use multifilter.
You should first read the INSTALL file and check the
"multifilter.conf-EXAMPLE" file in the "spam-filtering" directory.

On start up ("./spam-filtering/multifilter-start"), multifilter validates
the configuration file and starts every external programs configured
in the configuration file.

When an article is read in multifilter from the server, multifilter
writes the article to every program(s) declared in the configuration
file.  It does this starting with the first program declared in the
configuration file until a program refused the article or until it
reaches the end of the list of programs.


There are 4 utilities in the "spam-filtering" directory which
are easy to understand:

    multifilter-start
    multifilter-validate
    multifilter-statsnow
    multifilter-reload


multifilter-start:

  -  validates your configuration and starts multifilter

multifilter-validate aka "./spam-filtering/multifilter -V":

  -  validates your configuration file.  If there are any
     errors, they will be printed on the stderr output.

multifilter-reload:

  -  validates the configuration file and if the file is good, a signal
     is sent to multifilter so it can re-read the configuration files
     and restart the programs according to the new configuration file!

multifilter-statsnow:

  -  tells multifilter to write the latest stats.
