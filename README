Welcome to multifilter!

multifilter allows you to run multiple spam-filtering programs
on your servers (Typhoon, Breeze, Cyclone from Highwind's Software).
It also allows you to start/stop/add/remove spam-filtering
programs on-the-fly without the need to restart your server.

You might want to consult http://www.highwind.com/antispam.html for
a list of spam-filtering programs available for Highwind Software's
products.  For more documentations on how multifilter interacts
with the server, please check the documentation on Highwind
Software's Web server (http://www.highwind.com/doc).

If you want to report a bug, a patch or a suggestion, please send your
mail to "belanger@pobox.com".
