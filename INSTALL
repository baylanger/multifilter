Installation of multifilter is quite simple.  Here is a good
way to do it:

1- Compile the program using "make".  You might want/have to edit
   the Makefile.  The binary is created in the "spam-filtering"
   directory.


2- Move the directory "spam-filtering" in your $NEWS/bin


3- Move/Install your filtering programs in the "$NEWS/bin/spam-filtering"
   directory.

   I suggest the following hierarchie within your "$NEWS/bin"
   directory:

   spam-filtering/:
   cleanfeed/            multifilter-start     multifilter.conf
   multifilter           multifilter-statsnow  spamhippo/
   multifilter-reload    multifilter-validate

   spam-filtering/cleanfeed:
   CHANGES             cleanfeed.8         cleanfeed.local.ex  README
   cleanfeed           cleanfeed.conf      cleanfeed.man

   spam-filtering/spamhippo:
   artcnt.db    article.ldb  spamhippo    starthippo   README


4- Edit the start up scripts and configuration files from your
   filtering program to reflect the new location.


5- Create a "multifilter.conf" file in the "spam-filtering" directory.
   Check the multifilter.conf-EXAMPLE for for instructions from the
   same directory.


6- Run "./spam-filtering/multifilter-validate".  Correct any errors.
   You might want to check the default values and options of multifilter
   by running "./multifilter -h".


7- Edit the start up script of your server to run the following spam-filtering
   program:

         "./spam-filtering/multifilter-start"
